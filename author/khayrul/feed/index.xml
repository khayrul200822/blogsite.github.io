										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &#8220;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&#8221; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &#8220;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&#8221;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

<p>It was Saudi Arabia&#8217;s first effort &#8211; but it would not be their last. Just five minutes later, Salem Al Dawsari scored one of the goals of the tournament to launch the Saudis into an astonishing lead. An exceptional save at close range from Mohammed Al Owais shortly after preserved the underdog’s lead, and the Albiceleste failed to meaningfully threaten for the remainder of this astonishing match.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" src="./../../../wp-content/uploads/2022/12/argentina.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-2083" width="821" height="462"/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">argentina match</figcaption></figure>


<h3 id="key-moment%25ef%25bb%25bf-saudi-suckerpunch">Key Moment﻿: Saudi sucker-punch</h3>


<p>It was the moment in which the world held its breath. As the ball was launched downfield, few onlookers would have predicted the devastation that Al Shehri would cause when he latched onto the ball.</p>



<p>Pushing the ball into the box, <a href="https://www.espn.com/soccer/team/fixtures/_/id/202/argentina" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it appeared </a>as though he had taken himself too wide to cause the defence any trouble. However, taken quickly and with electric sparking through every inch of the World Cup ball, the flashing shot was past the Argentina goalkeeper before he could blink. While Saudi Arabia’s winner will justifiably grab the headlines, this was the goal that initiated lift off.</p>


<h3 id="argentina-start-of-the-match">Argentina Start of the Match</h3>


<p>Lionel Messi came close to bookending the statistics for youngest and oldest World Cup goalscorer for Argentina. Having become the youngest (18 years and 357 days) in 2006, he today became the second oldest (35 years and 151 days).</p>



<p>This is a record of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argentina</a>&#8216;s results at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIFA World Cup</a>. Argentina won two World Cups: in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_FIFA_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1978</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1986</a>. Argentina has been runners up three times: in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1930</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1990_FIFA_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1990</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014</a>. In 18 World Cup tournaments, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Argentina</a> had 48 victories in 84 matches. The team was present in all but four of the World Cups, being behind only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazil_national_football_team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germany_national_football_team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Germany</a> in number of appearances (with the 2022 edition included, being played).</p>

<p>Argentina has also won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copa_Am%C3%A9rica" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Copa América</a> 15 times, the highest amount, tied with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uruguay_national_football_team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Uruguay</a>. Moreover,  has also won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Confederations_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Confederations Cup</a> and the gold medal at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_qualification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2004</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_2008_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_qualification" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2008</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Olympic football tournaments</a>. Prior to that, Argentina won two silver medals in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_1928_Summer_Olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1928</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_1996_Summer_Olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1996</a> editions. On other levels of international competition, Argentina has won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_U-20_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-20 World Cup</a> six times. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_U-17_World_Cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U-17 World Cup</a> is the only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FIFA</a> international competition yet to be won by Argentina.</p>



<p>Over one year younger than Martin Palermo and having claimed Qatar 2022 will be his final World Cup, it is unlikely he will complete the feat.</p>

<p>Haleem , Bangladeshi style</p>



<p>Iftar in Ramadan is never so exciting and complete without a bowl of Haleem !! Truly a very special dish , enjoyed not only in Ramadan but also through out the year in any occasion !! Haleem made with mutton is the most popular one no doubt , but now a days beef haleem and chicken haleem also getting their popularity. I always loved my Mom’s haleem . It’s always been a great hit at any iftar party at our home !! Some friends and relatives, prior to the party used to call Mom to make sure it’s being prepared in good quantity so that they can take some left overs to home too !!! <br>My today’s post is dedicated to my Mom !!! No matter how sick she was she always tried to please each and everyone of the family during the iftar time with their favorite food !! She is suffering from so many diseases now a days. Please everyone keep her in your prayers !!! May this Ramadan bring lots of blessings to everyone !!!</p>

<ul>
<li>Step 1 Soak broken wheat for 30 minutesTo prepare this popular <a href="https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/100518/telangana-costly-chicken-sours-haleem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hyderabadi delicacy</a>, wash and soak the broken wheat or dalia for half an hour.

<ol>
<li>Traditionally, this is a slow-cooked dish. So, whenever you opt to make Hyderabadi Haleem, try to cook it in handi and over slow flame.</li>



<li>Try to use a little rice in the dish, as it will provide starch to your Haleem and bind it nicely.</li>



<li>Be generous while using ghee in the preparation of Hyderabadi Haleem. This will not only provide the flavour but improve the texture of the dish.</li>



<li>While cooking Haleem, don&#8217;t add lemon juice in it as it can kill the real flavours of the dish. Always add it on top of Haleem as a garnish along with some fried onion. It will ta&#8230;</li>



<li>If there is some leftover of this dish, you can store it in an air-tight box for up to 7 days. Just reheat in microwave for 2 minutes when you want to eat and it will remain delic&#8230;</li>



<li>You can use chicken in place of mutton as well. However, tone down the amount of spices a little if you use chicken.</li>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.tigercricket.com.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cricket-Bangladesh</a></strong> all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz scored an unbeaten 100 from 83 balls and grabbed two wickets to help his side beat India by five runs in their second one-day international in Mirpur on Wednesday, sealing a 2-0 series victory with one game left to play.</p>



<p>Chasing 272 to win, India got off to a disappointing start losing openers <strong>Cricket-Bangladesh</strong> Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan early before half-centuries by Shreyas Iyer (82) and Axar Patel (56) got them back on track.</p>



<p>But India’s middle order suffered a collapse and they fell just short in their run chase, ending on 266-9.</p>



<p>Indian captain Rohit Sharma (51 not out) came in to bat at number nine after undergoing a scan for a left thumb injury he sustained when <strong><a href="https://www.tigercricket.com.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cricket-Bangladesh</a></strong> he dropped Anamul Haque in the second over of Bangladesh’s innings, and he rode his luck to take India close.</p>



<p>Playing through the pain – and twice dropped – he hit huge sixes off Ebadot Hossain and Mahmudullah in his 28-ball knock to leave India needing 20 off the final over and then 12 from the last two balls, but he was unable to haul his side over the line.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s very incidable for Bangladesh:</p>

<p>Earlier, Bangladesh, <strong>Cricket-Bangladesh</strong> who also beat India by one wicket in the first ODI, were in trouble at 69-6 having elected to bat first as Washington Sundar (3-37) and Mohammed Siraj (2-73) ripped through the top order before the hosts hit back.</p>



<p><a href="./../../../index.html">Mehidy combined</a> with Mahmudullah (77) in a 148-run stand for the seventh wicket as India stepped off the gas, and the 25-year-old reached <strong><a href="https://www.tigercricket.com.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cricket-Bangladesh</a></strong> his century with the last ball of the innings as Bangladesh put on 271-7.</p>

<p>Bangladesh beat India by five runs in yesterday’s one-day game at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka. With the triumph, the hosts clinched the three-match series 2-0. Batting first after winning the toss, Bangladesh posted a competitive 271-7. In response, the Men in Blue only managed 266-9 as they fell tantalisingly short of the target.</p>



<p>Bangladesh got off to a terrible start, losing their first six wickets for only 69 runs in 19 overs. Mohammed Siraj dismissed both Bangladesh openers Anamul Haque (11) and Litton Das (7). Fast bowler Umran Malik then cleaned up Najmul Hossain Shanto (21) with a 151-kph delivery.</p>

<p>Bangladesh team are very vamos in Mirpur wiket.Team India inched further ahead in the contest as off-spinner Washington Sundar claimed three quick wickets. He had Shakib Al Hasan (8) caught off a top edge, while Mushfiqur Rahim (12) and Afif Hossain (0) fell off consecutive deliveries.</p>



<p>At 69-6, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/bangladesh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bangladesh</a> were in danger of being bowled out cheaply. However, Mehidy Hasan Miraz (100* off 83) and Mahmudullah (77 off 96) featured in a brilliant seventh-wicket stand of 148 to lift the hosts.

<p>Chasing 272,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/india-national-cricket-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">India</a>&nbsp;were forced to open with Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan, as captain Rohit Sharma had injured his thumb while fielding. However, both perished cheaply.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/virat-kohli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kohli</a>&nbsp;(5) chopped on to an Ebadot Hossain delivery, while Dhawan (8) fended a brute from Mustafizur Rahman to point. Sundar (11) and KL Rahul (14) also perished cheaply as India found themselves in deep trouble at 65-4.</p>
