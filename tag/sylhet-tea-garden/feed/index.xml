This estate was officially established in 1875, and it now produces an astounding 550 tons of tea each year. </p>



<p>A number of dirt roads intersect the garden, some purpose-built to transport sylhet Tea Garden across and beyond the grounds. Others are simply part of a larger network of roads cutting through Lakkatura, taking visitors through hills of neatly manicured rows of tea plants. Following the latter set of roads takes you to several rural villages in and around Lakkatura estate, including makeshift villages where migrant workers live during the harvest.</p>

In 2012, Bangladesh produced more than 70,000 tons of tea.
