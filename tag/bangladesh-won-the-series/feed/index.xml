<p><strong><a href="https://www.tigercricket.com.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cricket-Bangladesh</a></strong> all-rounder Mehidy Hasan Miraz scored an unbeaten 100 from 83 balls and grabbed two wickets to help his side beat India by five runs in their second one-day international in Mirpur on Wednesday, sealing a 2-0 series victory with one game left to play.</p>



<p>Chasing 272 to win, India got off to a disappointing start losing openers <strong>Cricket-Bangladesh</strong> Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan early before half-centuries by Shreyas Iyer (82) and Axar Patel (56) got them back on track.</p>



<p>But India’s middle order suffered a collapse and they fell just short in their run chase, ending on 266-9.</p>



<p>Indian captain Rohit Sharma (51 not out) came in to bat at number nine after undergoing a scan for a left thumb injury he sustained when <strong><a href="https://www.tigercricket.com.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cricket-Bangladesh</a></strong> he dropped Anamul Haque in the second over of Bangladesh’s innings, and he rode his luck to take India close.</p>



<p>Playing through the pain – and twice dropped – he hit huge sixes off Ebadot Hossain and Mahmudullah in his 28-ball knock to leave India needing 20 off the final over and then 12 from the last two balls, but he was unable to haul his side over the line.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s very incidable for Bangladesh:</p>

</ul>



<p>Earlier, Bangladesh, <strong>Cricket-Bangladesh</strong> who also beat India by one wicket in the first ODI, were in trouble at 69-6 having elected to bat first as Washington Sundar (3-37) and Mohammed Siraj (2-73) ripped through the top order before the hosts hit back.</p>



<p><a href="./../../../index.html">Mehidy combined</a> with Mahmudullah (77) in a 148-run stand for the seventh wicket as India stepped off the gas, and the 25-year-old reached <strong><a href="https://www.tigercricket.com.bd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cricket-Bangladesh</a></strong> his century with the last ball of the innings as Bangladesh put on 271-7.</p>



<p>The teams meet in the final game in Chattogram on Saturday before playing two tests.</p>

<h3 id="cricketbangladesh-1st-odi-bangladesh-vs-india">Cricket-Bangladesh: 1st Odi (Bangladesh vs India)</h3>


<p>Bangladesh beat India by five runs in yesterday’s one-day game at the Shere Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka. With the triumph, the hosts clinched the three-match series 2-0. Batting first after winning the toss, Bangladesh posted a competitive 271-7. In response, the Men in Blue only managed 266-9 as they fell tantalisingly short of the target.</p>



<p>Bangladesh got off to a terrible start, losing their first six wickets for only 69 runs in 19 overs. Mohammed Siraj dismissed both Bangladesh openers Anamul Haque (11) and Litton Das (7). Fast bowler Umran Malik then cleaned up Najmul Hossain Shanto (21) with a 151-kph delivery.</p>

<p>Bangladesh team are very vamos in Mirpur wiket.Team India inched further ahead in the contest as off-spinner Washington Sundar claimed three quick wickets. He had Shakib Al Hasan (8) caught off a top edge, while Mushfiqur Rahim (12) and Afif Hossain (0) fell off consecutive deliveries.</p>



<p>At 69-6, <a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/bangladesh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bangladesh</a> were in danger of being bowled out cheaply. However, Mehidy Hasan Miraz (100* off 83) and Mahmudullah (77 off 96) featured in a brilliant seventh-wicket stand of 148 to lift the hosts. Bangladesh smashed 68 runs off the last five overs as Mehidy brought up his maiden ODI hundred off the last ball of the innings.</p>

<p>Chasing 272,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/team/india-national-cricket-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">India</a>&nbsp;were forced to open with Virat Kohli and Shikhar Dhawan, as captain Rohit Sharma had injured his thumb while fielding. However, both perished cheaply.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/player/virat-kohli" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kohli</a>&nbsp;(5) chopped on to an Ebadot Hossain delivery, while Dhawan (8) fended a brute from Mustafizur Rahman to point. Sundar (11) and KL Rahul (14) also perished cheaply as India found themselves in deep trouble at 65-4.</p>
