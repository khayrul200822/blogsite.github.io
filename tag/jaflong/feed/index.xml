<p>Jaflong is located in Gowainghat Upazila of Sylhet district of Bangladesh, 62 kilometers north-east of Sylhet city, on the foothills of the Khasia-Jaintia hill along India’s Meghalaya border. On the opposite side, it is Khasia Jaintia hill, and in this side the river on the east. The fountain is going on in the hills, and the pebbles of various colored stones on the level of the river. If you look from the distance, it will seem the mountains are standing reclining with the sky. <strong><a href="https://www.travelmate.com.bd/jaflong-travel-guideline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jaflong</a></strong> the white clouds are flying touching the mountains. Where else can this kind of beauty be found, except Jaflong?</p>
