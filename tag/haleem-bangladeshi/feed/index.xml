<p>Haleem , Bangladeshi style</p>



<p>Iftar in Ramadan is never so exciting and complete without a bowl of Haleem !! Truly a very special dish , enjoyed not only in Ramadan but also through out the year in any occasion !! Haleem made with mutton is the most popular one no doubt , but now a days beef haleem and chicken haleem also getting their popularity. I always loved my Mom’s haleem . It’s always been a great hit at any iftar party at our home !! Some friends and relatives, prior to the party used to call Mom to make sure it’s being prepared in good quantity so that they can take some left overs to home too !!! <br>My today’s post is dedicated to my Mom !!! No matter how sick she was she always tried to please each and everyone of the family during the iftar time with their favorite food !! She is suffering from so many diseases now a days. Please everyone keep her in your prayers !!! May this Ramadan bring lots of blessings to everyone !!!</p>
